# MIT Missing Semester Quizzes

This GitHub repository is dedicated to helping students who are following [MIT's Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course reinforce their learning through quizzes.

Each folder corresponds to a specific lecture and includes:

- A set of quiz questions to test understanding
- Answer keys for self-assessment

The goal is to provide an easy way to actively recall and retain key concepts from the course.

This is a learning resource made by students, for students.
